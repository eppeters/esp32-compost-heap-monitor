    <h1>Compost Heap Temperatures</h1>
    <p>
      An ESP32 microcontroller is mounted in my backyard above my compost heap
      along with a few sensors. This page visualizes the data collected by it.
      Visualizations include a heatmap of the top of the compost and a
      timeseries of temperatures at 6 inches, 1 foot, and 2 feet from the ground
      inside the pile.
    </p>
    <h2>Top-of-the-pile heatmap</h2>

      <div id="infared"></div>
      <figcaption>
        A heatmap of the top of the compost, taken by the MLX90640 thermal
        camera. Drag the triangle left and right to scroll through historic
        heatmaps, and hover over pixels to see the temperature at that position.

    <h2>Internal heap temperatures</h2>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>
        Temperatures at three levels inside the pile.
        Three temperature probes are mounted on a wooden stick. The nice curve
        is a bit of a lie since data is logged at most once every four hours.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      An ESP32 is mounted in my backyard above my compost heap. Every 4 hours it
      tries to capture a data from an MLX90640 thermal camera and three DS18B20
      temperature sensors that are mounted at 3 places in the pile (6 inches
      above ground, 1 foot, and 2 feet). The ESP32 then sends the data to AWS
      IoT Core, where IoT Analytics process all data for the current month into
      a CSV that is then visualized below with D3.js.
